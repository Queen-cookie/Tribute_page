            <h3>Timeline/ life of Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sayid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan (Somali: Sayid Maxamed Cabdulle Xasan; 1856â€“1920) was a Somali religious and military leader of the Dervish movement. It was subdivided into 13 administrative divisions, of which the four largest were Shiikhyaale, Dooxato, Golaweyne and Miinanle, a setting which in the midst of colonial expansionism eventually set the stage for a two-decade long confrontation with various colonial empires including the British, Italians, and Abyssinians.</li>
